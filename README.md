# The robustness of long memory estimators

Authors: Wen Hoong Koay & Wei Ying Soh

## Abstract
When attempting to discern whether a particular tim series exhibits long memory or not, the ability of the long memory estimator to isolate
the long memory component from other characteristics (e.g., short-run dynamics, leptokurtosis) of the time series becomes of first order impor-
tance. 
We employ a Monte Carlo study to test the robustness and analyze the finite sample behavior of the estimators of long-range dependence for
eight estimation methods. We find that no single estimator consistently outperforms the others for our extensive set of simulated time series with
Gaussian, generalized hyperbolic, and stable innovations.
